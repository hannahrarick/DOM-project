    <p>There's something unique about music: bringing unlikely people together. Whether it's a good experience or bad, music can build experiences, friendships and lasting memories. (click this box!) </p>

    <p>People mostly learn and create an empathetic bond when they have things in common. Going to a concert, it's easy to find that common link solely by looking around. Each person went either because he or she loved the artist/band already or went to learn more. </p>
      <p>Regardless, the passion and excitement are there. The conversations buzz all around because it's simple to turn to the next persont there and ask what their favorite song is, what they're most excited about. These moments allow us to see the similarities we have with one another as humans for at least the night. And maybe, just maybe, it impacts us enough to see it when we leave.</p>
